# Notes

**Task 1: Store first name and display in Goals.vue**

- The current live Thriva survey also collects surname, so I have labelled the getting/setting of 'name' as 'firstName' for transparency (if a surname task was added later on).
- I have used the mapGetters helper to simplify accessing the getters - may be useful in later tasks rather than writing out the store path each time. 
- Decided to remove the action for task 1 as its not an asynch task and has no other logic - so only mutation needed.
